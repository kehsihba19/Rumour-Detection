# Rumour-Detection
Estimating the source of a rumor in large-scale social networks. 

## Points covered
<li> Internode relationship strengths in real social networks are random. 
<li> We model this uncertainty by using random, non homogeneous edge weights on the underlying social network graph. 
<li> A novel two-stage algorithm that uses the modularity of the social network to locate the source of the rumor with fewer sensor nodes than other existing algorithms. 
<li> We also propose a novel method to select these sensor nodes. 
<li> We evaluate our algorithm using the data set of Karate Kid, Dolphin, and Football. 
<li> Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can determine the actual source within two hops, 69%â€“80% of the time when the diameter of the networks varies between 7 and 13. 
<li> Our numerical results also show that it is easier to estimate the source of a rumor when the source has higher betweenness centrality.
